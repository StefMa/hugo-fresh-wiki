There is an example in the <a href="http://www.github.com/stefma/hugo-fresh-wiki/exampleSite" target="_blank">exampleSite dir</a> at GitHub.

Beside of this the following shortcodes are available in markdown:
```
title[1-6]
subtitle[1-6]
```
You can use it by wrapping it into curly brakets:
```
{% title1 "How to shortcodes" %} // but with two curly brakets ðŸ™ƒ
```
This code will lead to:
{{% title1 "How to shortcodes" %}}
